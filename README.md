## Description
This project takes user input and uses it to create a professional README file. Throughout the project I was able to work on my node.js skills as well as inquirer.js.One of the challenges I faced while working on this challenge was understading how the Questions method worked with Inquirer. I also struggled with GitHub initially since I did not add a gitignore.

## Installation
Install Node.js and inquirer verion 8.2.4 by using the command line in terminal.

## Usage
To use this app, please read the installation isntructions first. Once Node.js and inquirer are installed, in the command line type node index.js to initate the application. Answer the prompts. Once all answers have been completed, you will get a message that your README file is being generated. Click on the README file to see your answers in your new and completed read me!
